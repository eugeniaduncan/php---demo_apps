Summary:

This folder provides a demo of a few sample apps, including a simple admin program to quickly and easily insert usernames and passwords into a database (create_users.php).  The sample apps are conveniently located within a demo app at http://www.declaremath.com/demos.

The Sample Apps section of the Demo App contains two apps, a Create Users app and a Random Name app.  These apps can only be demonstrated live within the demo app given the appropriate login credentials.  However, see descriptions and visuals below.

The Math Apps section of the Demo App contains two apps, a Math Game app and a Math Book app.  These apps can be demonstrated live on the website with no login required.  You can just go directly to the Demo App home page and click on the appropriate links to see these math apps.  You may also see descriptions below.

Create Users App:

The Create Users app is a program I created a while ago for both practice and convenience while working as a DBA / PHP Dev.  The code for this app (create_users.php) is listed in this repository.  However, depending on proprietary reasons, the code for other sample apps may or may not be provided at this time.

The Create Users app is a simple form requesting username and password:

You only need to make minor alterations to the code (database settings, etc.) and then you will be able to insert values into the database and see the results on the page:

Random Name App:

The Random Name app is a program I initially designed long ago while teaching in order to make the process of calling on students seem more fair.  Since then I've cleaned up the UI and added at least a minimal layer of security for demonstration purposes.

The Random Name app starts off with an input page where the user selects the type of queue and then enters the maximum number of participants in the queue:

Here I chose to select the Queue Remove option where each student's name is deleted from the queue when selected:

Math Game App:

The Math Game app is a program I created long ago while teaching in order to help students come up to speed on their math facts.  At the time I was amazed to find that many high school students could not recall their math facts quickly enough, which was my initial motivation for creating the app.  Eventually quite a few parents and elementary school teachers also found this app useful for their own kids and students.  This app can be viewed live on the demo site.

Math Book App:

The Math Book app is a program I created a while ago for the convenience of reading my math book online.  At the time, readers had the option of reading the book online for free or purchasing an ebook or a hardcopy within the ecommerce section of the website.  This app can be viewed live on the demo site.
